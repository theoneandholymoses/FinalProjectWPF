## Games

### 1. Tic Tac Toe
This classic Tic Tac Toe game allows two players to compete on a 3x3 grid. Players can choose between two modes: a two-player mode where they take turns placing X's and O's, and a single-player mode against a computer opponent. The computer offers two difficulty levels—Easy, which makes random moves, and Hard, which employs strategic calculations to determine the best move. The game features visual indicators for the current player's turn, checks for win conditions, and provides the option to reset the board for a new game. This project emphasizes strategic thinking and provides a straightforward yet engaging interface.

### 2. Snake Game
In this engaging Snake game, players control a snake that grows longer as it eats apples. The game utilizes images to represent different parts of the snake: a unique head, a slender body, and a triangular tail end for added realism. Players must navigate the snake to avoid collisions with itself and the walls while trying to collect as many apples as possible. The game includes smooth image-based movement, effective collision detection, and customizable settings to enhance the overall gameplay experience.

### 3. Catch the Egg
Catch the Egg is an interactive game where players must catch falling eggs with a basket. Players navigate the basket horizontally to catch various types of eggs, including special eggs that grant abilities or bonuses. If an egg reaches the bottom without being caught, it is replaced with a broken egg image for a short duration, adding a fun visual element. The game allows for resets to clear the screen and start anew, making it a refreshing experience every time. Additionally, high scores are tracked and presented in a table format, enabling players to see their achievements.

### 4. Business Management
This comprehensive business management application provides functionalities to handle items, customers, invoices, orders, and refunds. Users can easily manage inventory, track customer interactions, and process financial transactions efficiently. The application supports sending invoices directly to customers' email addresses and allows users to download invoices to their devices. It also integrates with an API for validating payment methods, ensuring secure transactions. The system is designed to offer a user-friendly interface for managing various business operations, ensuring that users can navigate through different features seamlessly.

### 5. Don't Drop the Million
Don't Drop the Million is a trivia game that leverages the Open Trivia Database API to provide players with an exciting quiz experience. The game features multiple-choice questions across various categories, challenging players' knowledge and quick thinking. Players aim to answer as many questions correctly as possible while competing against a timer or other players. Additionally, this game requires API keys that should be added to the project from CardCom company for seamless functionality. The design encourages engagement and learning, making it both entertaining and educational.

## File and User Management

The project includes a robust file manager and user manager, allowing the tracking of multiple users and performing CRUD operations effectively. High scores for each game (Snake, Catch the Egg, Don't Drop the Million) are stored and presented in organized tables, enabling players to view their performance and compete for top positions. Each game has a dedicated preview page that showcases information about the game and displays the high scores table, enhancing user engagement and providing clear insights into player achievements.
